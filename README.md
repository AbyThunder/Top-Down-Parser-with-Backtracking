# Top-Down-Parser-with-Backtracking

The goal is to create a Top-Down parser with backtracking which can take input and parse that input 
through the tree from top to bottom and will backtrack at each step when the production doesnâ€™t match 
with the needed string. We assume that the input will be provided as a single file where the grammar is 
defined in a specific way and then the string being parsed and checked is inputted by the user
